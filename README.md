# K_Means_Clustering_Electric_Drivers

In here I have find out how many drivers drive their electric vahicles in various patterns, How fast the driver is driving and how long he is travelling, etc. 
Unique drivers are seperated into various clusters. 
Also, every cluster can be seen of 4 colors, to represent each cluster seperately.
